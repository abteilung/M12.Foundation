# M12.Foundation - Foundation components inside TYPO3 Neos

M12.Foundation aims to implement all [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) components, in the best possible way, inside [TYPO3 Neos](http://neos.typo3.org/) CMS.

The best way is to install it together with [M12.FoundationSite](https://github.com/million12/M12.FoundationSite) Neos site package. It **conflicts with NeosDemoTypo3Org**, so remember to remove `typo3/neosdemotypo3org` dependency from your `composer.json`.

## Usage

This plugin currently works with TYPO3 Neos, version 1.2.*.

You can try ready-to-use [neos-typostrap-distribution](https://github.com/million12/neos-typostrap-distribution), TYPO3 Neos distribution which has this installed and configured.

**Alternatively**, include in your main `composer.json` file:  
``` json
    "require": {
        "other-dependenies-here...": "*",
        # "typo3/neosdemotypo3org": "x.y.z", # Remember to remove this one 
        "m12/neos-foundation": "dev-master",
        "m12/neos-foundation-site": "dev-master"
    },
```  
and run `composer install`
