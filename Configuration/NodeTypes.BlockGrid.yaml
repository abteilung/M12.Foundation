        _Block Grid_ gives you a way to **evenly split contents within the grid**. For example, if you wanted to create a row of three images or paragraphs that need to stay **evenly spaced** no matter the screen size, the block grid is for you.
        
        ### How to use?
        Add any content element **inside** Block Grid to have it evenly spaced. If you need a group of elements to behave like a single one, use _Container_ element first and then put other content inside it.
        
        _Block grid_ is configurable so you can specify how many elements per row you get for each screen size.
        
        ### Example
