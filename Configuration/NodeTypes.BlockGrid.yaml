        _Block Grid_ gives you a way to **evenly split contents within the grid**. For example, if you wanted to create a row of three images or paragraphs that need to stay **evenly spaced** no matter the screen size, the block grid is for you.
        
        ### How to use?
        Add any content element **inside** Block Grid to have it evenly spaced. If you need a group of elements to behave like a single one, use _Container_ element first and then put other content inside it.
        
        _Block grid_ is configurable so you can specify how many elements per row you get for each screen size.
        
        ### Example
        See _Block Grid_ in action [here](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/block_grid.html).

            When selected, images inside _Block Grid_ will be opened in a lightbox modal window.
            
            Caveat: select if you expect only images inside the _Block Grid_ element. If you want to mix the element with other types (e.g. Text), do NOT set this option as you might experience weird issues (your Text element being open in Lightbox as well).
